  "-66483142": "Martha believes strongly in the power of good design to affect our lives.  Good design employs a thoughtful consideration of light, scale, balance, proportion and function. It is these aspects that have the ability to not only make a space beautiful, but can make a space increase our well-being, calm us, nurture and even inspire us. Good design is not about a particular style, but about creating this well-being in a home that is a true reflection of the people living in it. ",
  "630b08d2": "Martha’s interior design career began at one of Architectural Digest’s “Top 100” architecture and design firms, Deborah Berke Partners, inNew York City. While there, she was involved in the design of a diverse range of projects from towering penthouses and urban brownstones to upstate country and ocean front beach homes.  ",
  "1f4be94f": "Before transitioning to interiors, Martha worked in the fashion industry as an editorial style assistant and accessories editor at Elle and Cosmopolitan magazines, and then as a wardrobe and prop stylist for film, television, and commercials. ",
  "-63793289": "She is a graduate with high honors of the New York School of Interior Design, and received a degree in Literature from American University in Washington DC. Though her education contributed to her knowledge of design, it is the many places she has called home that have had the greatest impact on her design philosophy. From a childhood spent in heavily Scandinavian influenced Minnesota to the Federal period of Washington D.C.; from the “OldWorld” charm of Paris to the modernity of New York City; from the beaches and sunshine of Southern California, to the idyllic countryside of Connecticut, and currently, the early American style of historic Savannah, GA, Martha has a deep appreciation for what it means to live in harmony with a place and the things you love.  ",
