  Created by Michael Anastassiades for Flos, the Captain Flint floor lamp is a
  feat of minimalistic design.

  A slender brushed brass stem anchored by a white marble base creates a harmony
  of elegant, timeless design. The versatile lamp features a rotating cone
  lampshade and a switch foot dimmer to adjust the light intensity. Works well
  as a reading lamp or as a floor lamp.
